## Data Science Workflow

This repository provides a structured approach to data science projects, detailing each stage from data acquisition to model deployment. The process emphasizes reproducibility, version control, and clear checkpoints, ensuring efficient collaboration and high-quality results.

### Requirements
1. **Basic Python Environment**  
   - A compatible version of Python (commonly 3.7 or higher) is needed to run the provided scripts and notebooks.  
   - Typical data science libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn) may be involved.  

2. **Supporting Libraries**  
   - Visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) are used during exploratory analysis.  
   - Additional libraries are required for specialized tasks (e.g., requests for data scraping and SQLalchemy for database connections).

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- Acquire raw data from reliable sources.
- Clean and transform datasets to ensure consistency and integrity.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Conduct statistical and visual explorations to uncover patterns or issues.
- Refine data features iteratively based on insights and findings.

### 3. Model Development and Validation
- Experiment with various modeling techniques and track performance.
- Employ robust validation methods (e.g., trainâ€“test splits, cross-validation) to assess model accuracy.

### 4. Deployment and Monitoring
- Package the final model and associated scripts for production.
- Continuously monitor model performance in real-world settings and iterate as necessary.
